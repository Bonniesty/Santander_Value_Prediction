# Santander_Value_Prediction

Our final code combines feature learning (including PCA and k-means..) and LightGBM to train the model and predict the target data. 

Since our dataset is too big to upload, please download our train data and test data here. Put raw data file in ```data``` folder.

To run our model and see the result, download the repo and run the following command

```python 
python3 model.py
```

Training result, analysis, as well as plots can be found in the console. Submission file is also created.


To see the plot of PCA and variance, open the ```Santander_Value_Prediction_Plot.ipynb``` file in notebook and run all the cells.
