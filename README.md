# Santander_Value_Prediction

Our final code combines feature learning (including PCA and k-means..) and LightGBM to train the model and predict the target data. 

Since our dataset is too big to upload, please download our train data and test data [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xS0IMsJD8dm8lKYizYs1pVxsSMtC1SrX?usp=sharing). Download our repo and put raw data file in ```data``` folder.

To run our model and see the result, please run the following command

```python 
python3 model.py
```

Training result, analysis, as well as plots can be found in the console. Submission file is also created.


To see the plot of PCA and variance, open the ```Santander_Value_Prediction_Plot.ipynb``` file in notebook and run all the cells.
